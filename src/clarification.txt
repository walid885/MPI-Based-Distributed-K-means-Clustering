# Astronomical Data Analysis and K-means Clustering - Step-by-Step Explanation

This document explains each step of the data analysis process for the astronomical dataset, in chronological order.

## 1. Data Loading and Initial Inspection
- We load the dataset using pandas to work with the tabular data structure
- The dataset contains information about astronomical objects with features like object IDs, coordinates, photometric measurements, and classifications

## 2. Handling Missing Values (-9999)
- In astronomical datasets, the value -9999 is commonly used as a placeholder for missing data
- We replace these values with NaN (Not a Number) to properly handle them in pandas
- For the photometric bands (u, g, r, i, z), we impute missing values with the median of each column
- This approach preserves the sample size while minimizing the impact on the distribution of values

## 3. Data Exploration
- We examine the class distribution to understand the balance between different astronomical objects (GALAXY, STAR, QSO)
- This helps set expectations for clustering and provides a reference for evaluating clustering results
- Visualizing the class distribution gives us insight into potential class imbalances

## 4. Feature Selection
- We focus on the photometric bands (u, g, r, i, z) which are the magnitude measurements across different wavelengths
- These features are most relevant for distinguishing between different types of astronomical objects
- Other features like coordinates or IDs are not useful for the clustering task

## 5. Feature Normalization
- K-means uses Euclidean distance, making it sensitive to the scale of features
- We standardize the features (subtract mean, divide by standard deviation) to ensure all features contribute equally
- This prevents features with larger scales from dominating the clustering process

## 6. Correlation Analysis
- We generate a correlation matrix to understand relationships between features
- High correlation between features may indicate redundancy in the data
- This helps us understand if certain wavelength bands provide similar or distinct information

## 7. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) helps visualize high-dimensional data in 2D
- It reveals natural clusters in the data and shows if classes are linearly separable
- The explained variance ratio tells us how much information is preserved in the 2D projection
- In our case, the first two components explain about 97.4% of the variance, indicating strong structure in the data

## 8. Finding Optimal K using Elbow Method
- The elbow method helps determine the optimal number of clusters
- We plot inertia (sum of squared distances to closest centroid) against different K values
- The "elbow" point indicates where adding more clusters provides diminishing returns
- For our dataset, K=3 appears to be a good choice, which aligns with the 3 known classes

## 9. K-means Clustering Implementation
- We implement K-means with the optimal K value identified
- K-means works by:
  1. Randomly initializing K centroids
  2. Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid
  3. Recalculating centroids based on the mean of points in each cluster
  4. Repeating steps 2-3 until convergence

## 10. Visualization and Analysis
- We visualize clustering results in the PCA space to see how well they align with known classes
- The quality of clustering is assessed through:
  - Visual inspection of cluster separation
  - Comparison with known classes
  - Analysis of cluster centers to understand what distinguishes each cluster

## 11. Insights Generation
- We save various visualizations (class distribution, correlation matrix, PCA visualization, elbow curve)
- These visualizations provide insights into the structure of astronomical data and the performance of K-means
- The analysis reveals how well unsupervised learning (K-means) can recover the known classes of astronomical objects
